# Apollo
A C codebase that implements different data structures, algorithms, abstractions. 
Idea inspired by @PixelRifts aka VoxelRifts.

# IMPORTANT:
As of right now Apollo is being rewritten, `master` branch would stay outdated until
`dev` branch has reimplemented (almost) all of the current headers from `master`.

### What is inside the toolbox
1. Arena Allocator (memseg)
2. Filesystem Interface (fsi)
3. String Views (strview)
4. Generic Hash Table (hashtable)
5. Cross Platform Wrapper for Sockets (xwsocks)
